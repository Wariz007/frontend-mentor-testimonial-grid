Project Title: Frontend Mentor Testimonial Grid

This README file is a personal note to self to record the things I learnt, found challenging, and problems I am yet to solve so I can revisit in future for reference purposes.

Difficulty:
This project was easy, and this is beacuse I have practiced with the Bento grid project in the past that was more complex than this. 

Compared to the Bento grid project, this one was simple and straightforward so it's code was not stressful and confusing.

Lessons:
I can't say I learnt anything because of how simple it is. I learn when I have difficulty getting things done, so the research and persistence I go through help me learn one or two new things that I can apply to future projects.
